## 🏗️ Architecture

```
app/
├── data/
│   ├── model/          # Data classes (Branch, Employee, UserProfile...)
│   └── repository/     # Firebase calls (Auth, Branch, Employee, Tracking)

**Pattern:** MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel)

```
UI (Compose) ──► ViewModel ──► Repository ──► Firebase

     └───────────────┘
        StateFlow (one-way data flow)
